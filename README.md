# Weather-Dashboard
This is an assignment for UCLAX Bootcamp that tests my knowledge of server-side APIs.

I used basic HTML and only a few lines of CSS; i incorporated Bootstrap but I don't know how to *really* use Bootstrap yet. I used a lot of JQuery and API calls to OpenWeathermap.org.  I wrapped all the .js script in a on.click event, os the page function is dependent on the user search input. I would like to have a default location for the weather dashboard, to display before the user inputs anything. 

Please feel free to comment or suggest improvements.
